Release history for xiate

next
  [Fixed]
  - There was a race condition in the communication between server and
    client. Depending on your machine (or its current load), the server
    might not have read all data sent by the client. Example: When
    running "xiatec -hold -e ls -al", the server might have dropped the
    "-e ..." part, thus running only a shell.

  [Changed]
  - xiatec now keeps running until the associated terminal window has
    been closed.
  - This requires a change in the protocol spoken between server and
    client. "H" now needs a NUL byte following it and the entire
    sequence must be enclosed in "S\000 .. F\000".
  - Also, the client has been reimplemented in C, so the dependency on
    Bash and socat is gone.
  - Sockets now live in /tmp/xiate-$uid.
  - xiate (the daemon) now aborts if there is an unexpected number of
    command line arguments. This prevents accidents like running "xiate
    --suffix test" which would result in the server listening on the
    "main" socket.

v17.10  2017-10-18
  [Changed]
  - We use vte_terminal_spawn_async() now, because the _sync() function
    has been deprecated. This means that you now get a proper error
    message on STDERR if spawning the main child process failed.

  [Added]
  - Support explicit hyperlinks. This adds the new variable
    "hyperlink_handler" to config.h and REQUIRES you to use VTE 0.50 or
    newer. See config.def.h for more info on that feature.

v17.09  2017-09-16
  [LICENSING]
  - The project has been relicensed under the MIT license (more
    precisely called "Expat License", but everyone calls it "MIT
    license" these days).

v17.02  2017-02-12
  [Fixed]
  - xiatec no longer fails if user parameters contain printf format
    strings (ouch).

  [Added]
  - xiate now hides the cursor and changes the window title when the
    child process exits and "-hold" is used.
  - xiate should cope better with OOM situations. We always try to keep
    the process running in order to *not* kill all your open terminal
    windows.

v16.12  2016-12-24
  [Changed]
  - The deprecated GRegex API is no longer being used by xiate.
  - xiate now expects at least VTE version 0.46.

  [Added]
  - Update geometry hints when changing font or font size.
  - xiate now responds to resize requests of terminal applications.
  - Terminal size (in terms of rows and columns) is being retained on
    changes to fonts or font size.

v16.10  2016-10-29
  [Added]
  - Multiple fonts can be specified and you can switch during runtime.

v16.08  2016-08-20
  [Added]
  - Foreground color of text under the cursor can be customized.

v16.06  2016-06-26
  [Changed]
  - Don't try to reduce flickering by setting the GtkWindow's background
    color anymore. This issue appears to have resolved itself (other VTE
    terminals are fine, too).
  - "internal_border" has been removed from config.h. If you really want
    to use an internal border, put this in your ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css:

        vte-terminal {
            padding: 30px;
        }

v16.05  2016-05-03
  - Update for slightly new VTE API.

v16.01  2016-01-05
  [Fixed]
  - Properly set X11 window title on the child application's request.
    Changing icon names is no longer officially supported, though.
  - Improve window size of newly created floating windows: Set geometry
    hints and use the correct font.

  [Changed]
  - Makefile also installs the default client.
  - Use CSS to set the "internal border". This results in the actual
    border being one pixel smaller than before.
  - "args_default" has been replaced by the boolean option "login_shell".
    We now autodetect your shell.
  - xiate now expects at least VTE version 0.42.

v15.10  2015-10-04
  - This is the initial release of xiate.
  - Daemon, client, manpages.
