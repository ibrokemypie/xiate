  [Fixed]
  - Set geometry hints on terminal windows. Newly created floating
    windows now have the correct size.

  [Changed]
  - Makefile also installs the default client.
  - Use CSS to set the "internal border". This results in the actual
    border being one pixel smaller than before.
  - "args_default" has been replaced by the boolean option
    "login_shell". We now autodetect your shell.
  - xiate now expects at least VTE version 0.42.
