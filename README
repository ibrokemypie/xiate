xiate is a terminal emulator.

It tries to keep a balance between "features" and "simplicity". This is
achieved by using VTE as a powerful backend, while UI, configuration,
and code try to remain much more minimalistic.


Installation
------------

The following C libraries (or newer versions) are required:

    - GTK+ 3.20
    - VTE 0.50

xiate expects to be run on a POSIX-ish operating system.

You can customize the program by creating your own config.h based on
config.def.h. In any case, config.h must exist in order to build the
program.

To build the program and install it to /usr/local:

    $ make
    # make install


Running
-------

For various reasons, xiate is split into two components: A daemon and a
client. You first start the daemon:

    $ xiate

It connects to the current X11 display (according to $DISPLAY), but does
not create any windows yet. It also creates a UNIX socket and waits for
connections. Using a simple protocol, you can instruct xiate to actually
launch a new terminal window and/or run a program:

    $ xiatec
    $ xiatec -e vim
