muTE is a minimalistic, unobtrusive terminal emulator.


Installation
------------

The following C libraries are required:

    - GTK+ 3
    - VTE 0.40.2

The following external tools are also required but kind of optional:

    - GNU bash
    - socat

muTE expects to be run on a POSIX-ish operating system.

You can customize the program by creating your own config.h based on
config.def.h. In any case, config.h must exist in order to build the
program.

To build the program and install it to /usr/local:

    $ make
    # make install


Running
-------

For various reasons, muTE is split into two components: A daemon and a
client. You first start the daemon:

    $ muted

It connects to the current X11 display (according to $DISPLAY).
