xinox is not XTerm.

Instead, it's a terminal emulator which tries to keep a balance between
"features" and "simplicity".


Installation
------------

The following C libraries are required:

    - GTK+ 3
    - VTE 0.40.2

The following external tools are also required but kind of optional:

    - GNU bash
    - socat

xinox expects to be run on a POSIX-ish operating system.

You can customize the program by creating your own config.h based on
config.def.h. In any case, config.h must exist in order to build the
program.

To build the program and install it to /usr/local:

    $ make
    # make install


Running
-------

For various reasons, xinox is split into two components: A daemon and a
client. You first start the daemon:

    $ xinoxd

It connects to the current X11 display (according to $DISPLAY), but does
not create any windows yet. It also creates a UNIX socket and waits for
connections. Using a simple protocol, you can instruct xinox to actually
launch a new terminal window and/or run a program:

    $ xinox
    $ xinox -e vim
