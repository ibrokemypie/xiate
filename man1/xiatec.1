.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBxiatec\fP is a client for xiate. You can use it to tell the server to
launch terminal windows.
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH OPTIONS
\fBxiatec\fP provides some common options which are compatible to
those of \fBxterm\fP(1). They all start with a single dash:
.TP
\fB\-class\fP \fIclass\fP
Sets the window's class (part of the X property WM_CLASS).
.TP
\fB\-e\fP \fIargs...\fP
Interpret all remaining arguments as an \(lqargument vector\(rq, i.e.
tell \fBxiate\fP what to run. This must be the last option on the
command line.
.TP
\fB\-hold\fP
Don't close the window after the command has finished.
.TP
\fB\-name\fP \fIname\fP
Sets the window's instance name (part of the X property WM_CLASS).
.TP
\fB\-title\fP \fItitle\fP
Sets the initial window title. Be aware that the title will very likely
be overwritten by child processes.
.P
The following options are unique to \fBxiatec\fP \(em they all start
with two dashes:
.TP
\fB\-\-suffix\fP \fIsuffix\fP
\fBxiate\fP creates a UNIX socket on which it listens for incoming
connections. This socket is named \(lqxiate-\fIsuffix\fP\(rq.
\fIsuffix\fP defaults to \fBmain\fP.

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
\fBxiatec\fP will exit with \fB0\fP if the child program running in the
terminal has exited cleanly. It will exit with \fB1\fP if there was any
error, or if the child exited with a non-zero exit code, or if the user
forcibly closed the terminal window.
.P
It is not possible to get the child's original exit code, because you
can't tell it apart from internal xiate errors anyway.
